                <p>My name is Ahmed, I am 16 years old with 6 years of experience as a graphic designer and 4 years of experience as a web developer. I am from Alexandria. In 2018, the whole world came to a standstill, and even students stopped attending school. I had a lot of free time, but unlike most people, I decided not to stop. Instead, I began learning design using Photoshop and Illustrator, mastering them, and participating in many competitions where I won several awards. What started as a hobby turned into a source of income, as my father worked in advertising, and I became his personal designer. In 2020, I heard about web development, started learning it, and became a front end developer. However, when I entered high school, I stopped completely. Then, I found a programming camp and joined it to refresh my memory, as I had forgotten almost 75% of what I had learned</p>
